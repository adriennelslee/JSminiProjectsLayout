    <p>Dear viewer,</p>

    <p> 
        This page encompasses the use of CSS grid to present some mini javascript projects. The aim was to try complete one a day, 
        in hopes of gaining a better understanding of how Javascript in incorperated in a practical sense.

    <p> <span class="note"> NB:</span> there may be some random imagery, quotes and bits along the page, but this was just for practice purposes with
        my grid layout. The randomness was not so much intentional. </p>
