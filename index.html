    <h2> They say practice makes perfect </h2>

    <p>Dear viewer,</p>

    <p> 
        This page encompasses the use of CSS grid to present some mini javascript projects. The aim was to try complete one a day, 
        in hopes of gaining a better understanding of how Javascript in incorperated in a practical sense.

      </p>
    </div>


    <p> <span class="note"> NB:</span> there may be some random imagery, quotes and bits along the page, but this was just for practice purposes with
        my grid layout. The randomness was not so much intentional. </p>

      hands stuck behind thumb tacks on my wall. I’ve got an ache in my chest for every season I miss and it gets worse when
      the snow starts to fall. There are butterflies alive in that couple’s eyes a few years since forgotten by all, and
      sometimes, if the phone starts to ring, I can still hear their wings when you call</p>

      <p><a href="#"> Project 11 - To be completed: </a><br>
      land of the gods, I think that things are timeless, but we are still prone to decay</p>
